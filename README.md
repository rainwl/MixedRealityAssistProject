## OverView
The main purpose of this project is to complete the XR challenge. 
I will use PICO 4 as the main device for development. 
If conditions permit, I may cooperate with iPadPro,iPhone,Android phone,HTC VIVE,
HoloLens, etc.

The project period is 2+1 months. The first phase lasts until 2023-7-31. 
If I can successfully pass the preliminary competition, I will have one month to prepare 
for the final.
